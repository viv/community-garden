# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
```

### üéØ CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:
- ‚úÖ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Project Overview
This project uses the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for systematic Test-Driven Development with AI assistance through Claude-Flow orchestration.

## SPARC Development Commands

### Core SPARC Commands
- `./claude-flow sparc modes`: List all available SPARC development modes
- `./claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"`: Execute specific SPARC mode for a task
- `./claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"`: Run complete TDD workflow using SPARC methodology
- `./claude-flow sparc info <mode>`: Get detailed information about a specific mode

### Standard Build Commands
- `npm run build`: Build the project
- `npm run test`: Run the test suite
- `npm run lint`: Run linter and format checks
- `npm run typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checking

## SPARC Methodology Workflow

### 1. Specification Phase
```bash
# Create detailed specifications and requirements
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Define user authentication requirements"
```
- Define clear functional requirements
- Document edge cases and constraints
- Create user stories and acceptance criteria
- Establish non-functional requirements

### 2. Pseudocode Phase
```bash
# Develop algorithmic logic and data flows
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create authentication flow pseudocode"
```
- Break down complex logic into steps
- Define data structures and interfaces
- Plan error handling and edge cases
- Create modular, testable components

### 3. Architecture Phase
```bash
# Design system architecture and component structure
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication service architecture"
```
- Create system diagrams and component relationships
- Define API contracts and interfaces
- Plan database schemas and data flows
- Establish security and scalability patterns

### 4. Refinement Phase (TDD Implementation)
```bash
# Execute Test-Driven Development cycle
./claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication system"
```

**TDD Cycle:**
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Optimize and clean up code
4. **Repeat**: Continue until feature is complete

### 5. Completion Phase
```bash
# Integration, documentation, and validation
./claude-flow sparc run integration "integrate authentication with user management"
```
- Integrate all components
- Perform end-to-end testing
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Validate against original requirements

## Claude Code Slash Commands

Claude Code slash commands are available in `.claude/commands/`:

### Project Commands
- `/sparc`: Execute SPARC methodology workflows
- `/sparc-<mode>`: Run specific SPARC mode (e.g., /sparc-architect)
- `/claude-flow-help`: Show all Claude-Flow commands
- `/claude-flow-memory`: Interact with memory system
- `/claude-flow-swarm`: Coordinate multi-agent swarms

### Using Slash Commands
1. Type `/` in Claude Code to see available commands
2. Select a command or type its name
3. Commands are context-aware and project-specific
4. Custom commands can be added to `.claude/commands/`

## Code Style and Best Practices

### SPARC Development Principles
- **Modular Design**: Keep files under 500 lines, break into logical components
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets or environment-specific values
- **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns, use dependency injection
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better tooling
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Memory and State Management
- Use claude-flow memory system for persistent state across sessions
- Store progress and findings using namespaced keys
- Query previous work before starting new tasks
- Export/import memory for backup and sharing

## SPARC Memory Integration

### Memory Commands for SPARC Development
```bash
# Store project specifications
./claude-flow memory store spec_auth "User authentication requirements and constraints"

# Store architectural decisions
./claude-flow memory store arch_decisions "Database schema and API design choices"

# Store test results and coverage
./claude-flow memory store test_coverage "Authentication module: 95% coverage, all tests passing"

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query auth_implementation

# Export project memory
./claude-flow memory export project_backup.json
```

### Memory Namespaces
- **`spec`**: Requirements and specifications
- **`arch`**: Architecture and design decisions
- **`impl`**: Implementation notes and code patterns
- **`test`**: Test results and coverage reports
- **`debug`**: Bug reports and resolution notes

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start with specification
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "User profile management feature"

# 2. Design architecture
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Profile service architecture with data validation"

# 3. Implement with TDD
./claude-flow sparc tdd "user profile CRUD operations"

# 4. Security review
./claude-flow sparc run security-review "profile data access and validation"

# 5. Integration testing
./claude-flow sparc run integration "profile service with authentication system"

# 6. Documentation
./claude-flow sparc run docs-writer "profile service API documentation"
```

### Bug Fix Workflow
```bash
# 1. Debug and analyze
./claude-flow sparc run debug "authentication token expiration issue"

# 2. Write regression tests
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "token refresh mechanism tests"

# 3. Implement fix
./claude-flow sparc run code "fix token refresh in authentication service"

# 4. Security review

## Troubleshooting

### Common SPARC Issues
- **Mode not found**: Check `.roomodes` file exists and is valid JSON
- **Memory persistence**: Ensure `memory/` directory has write permissions
- **Tool access**: Verify required tools are available for the selected mode
- **Namespace conflicts**: Use unique memory namespaces for different features

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check SPARC configuration
./claude-flow sparc modes

# Verify memory system
./claude-flow memory stats

# Check system status
./claude-flow status

# View detailed mode information
./claude-flow sparc info <mode-name>
```
